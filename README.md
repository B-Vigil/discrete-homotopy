# Discrete Homotopy Polynomial & Distance

This project provides a Python implementation of algorithms 1 and 2 described in **Section 3** of the paper [*Brain Chains as Topological Signatures for Alzheimer's Disease*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41468-024-00168-7) by Goodbrake et al. We also provide a boolean function that indicates when two maximal chains of the same length are *interleaved*.
